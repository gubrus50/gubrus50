Iâ€™m currently developing **django5-tutorial**, a private project that leverages modern full-stack development solutions to build a scalable, efficient, and secure web application.

**Progress: 75%, 25% to go** - Integrating Payment System on an international scale, and online communication with registered users in real-time using ASGI + webSocket connections.

Initially, this project was intended as a collection of personal and private notes. However, as my ventures have expanded in scope, I am beginning to reassess its potential. Given the depth of the expertise and knowledge accumulated over half a decade of dedicated, passion-driven software craftsmanship, I am now considering transforming it into a bookâ€”either later this year or the next.
